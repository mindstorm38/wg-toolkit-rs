//! This module defines applications and their elements, it provides abstraction over
//! the socket server for the different types of applications:
//! 
//! - Login app, the server-side application defining the protocol to establish an
//!   initial connection request from the client with initial RSA encryption and 
//!   then transfers the client to the base app once it's successful.
//! 
//! - Client app, the client-side application defining the protocol understood by 
//!   the client, where the client sends its entities and method calls to it.
//! 
//! - Base app, the server-side application defining the protocol understood by the 
//!   server, this is the application that is receiving the initial authentication
//!   key from client and then its method calls to entities.
//! 
//! - Cell app, the server-side application, not directly exposed to the client that
//!   is receiving requests from client when in-game.
